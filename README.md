idk
me to go to school
Ding ding ding ding ding!

The alarm clock goes off exactly at 
8;23
, waking up the 
complicated
 girl.

Time to 
not get up
 and get ready for 
diarrhea
!

First she 
mail
 breakfast. Then she brushes her 
semi truck
. Finally, she puts on her shoes.

Ready to go!

Carrying her 
bean
 in case of 
bacon
, she 
rapidly
 walks out to the 
contaianer
 and waits for the 
cloud
.

Today is going to be a good day! She's excited to learn: mathematics, 
music
, grammar, and 
pe
. Not to mention recess!

She can't wait to see her 
bananas
 and tell them about the 
banana/like
 
screen
 she did yesterday.
heehee!
